# Mono-alphabetic-Substitution-Decoder
Decodes any mono-alphabetic substitution cypher.

Unimplemented Ideas:
- Starting with the longest word, using the letters you already know because of the most common word, imput it in a Word Guesser, like https://github.com/Imaginatorix/Word-Guesser.
> Why was it not implemented? \
You need a database for each language, which is not ideal and practical for a small project like this.
